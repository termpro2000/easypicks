**Problem**: Test page showed partner list correctly, but user management form showed no users.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Partner List (Working)**: Used `testAPI.getPartnersList()` → `/api/test/partners` - fully implemented
- **User Management (Broken)**: Used `userAPI.getAllUsers()` → `/api/users` - only dummy implementation

**Investigation Process**:
1. ✅ Analyzed PartnersListModal component API calls
2. ✅ Analyzed UserManagement component API calls  
3. ✅ Compared API endpoints and backend implementation
4. ✅ Found `/api/users` endpoint only returned `{ message: '사용자 목록 API' }`

**Solution Implemented**:
- Complete implementation of `/backend/routes/users.js` with:
  - Real database queries for user data
  - Pagination support (page, limit parameters)
  - Search functionality (username, name, email, company)
  - Role filtering capability
  - Admin authorization checks
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Structured response with users array and pagination data

**Commit**: `e41cb4d` - "Fix user management API - implement complete users endpoint"

#### Partner Edit Modal 404 Error
**Problem**: Partner edit modal failed with "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404" error.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Frontend called `userAPI.updateUser()` → `PUT /users/:id`
- Backend `/routes/users.js` only had GET endpoint, missing PUT/POST/DELETE operations

**Solution Implemented**:
Complete CRUD API implementation in `/backend/routes/users.js`:

1. **GET /users/:id** - Single user retrieval
   - User existence validation
   - Proper error handling for not found cases
   - Clean response format with boolean type conversion

2. **POST /users** - User creation
   - Required field validation (username, password, name)
   - Username uniqueness checks
   - Password handling (with note for bcrypt in production)
   - Support for all user fields including partner-specific data

3. **PUT /users/:id** - User updates (fixes partner edit modal)
   - Dynamic field updates (only provided fields)
   - User existence validation
   - Username uniqueness validation (excluding current user)
   - Comprehensive field support for partner information

4. **DELETE /users/:id** - User deletion
   - User existence validation
   - Soft delete option available
   - Detailed logging and response

**Technical Features**:
- Admin role requirement for all operations

## Latest Session: Complete 52-Field Delivery Data System Implementation (2025-09-23)

### Major Achievement: 52-Field Complete Coverage System

This session focused on implementing a comprehensive delivery management system that handles all 52 database fields with complete data visibility and null value handling.

#### 🎯 Primary Issues Resolved

##### 1. Incomplete Field Storage in Delivery Creation
**Problem**: Test page delivery creation only stored 7 basic fields out of 52 available database columns.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Backend `createDelivery` function only mapped 7 fields: `tracking_number`, `sender_name`, `sender_address`, `customer_name`, `customer_phone`, `customer_address`, `product_name`
- Frontend sent 30+ fields but backend ignored most of them
- Missing field mapping for: construction details, product specifications, delivery options, cost information, completion status

**Solution Implementation**:
1. **Dynamic Column Detection System**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = DATABASE() AND TABLE_NAME = 'deliveries'
   ```
   - Runtime detection of all 52 database columns
   - Dynamic INSERT query generation
   - Prevents SQL errors from missing columns

2. **Comprehensive Field Mapping**:
   - **52 Complete Fields**: All database columns now mapped and stored
   - **Intelligent Parsing**: Automatic conversion of "50kg" → 50 for numeric fields
   - **Data Type Validation**: String vs numeric field handling
   - **Null Value Management**: Proper null handling for optional fields

3. **Frontend Data Processing**:
   - Added `parseNumber()` helper function in TestPage
   - Pre-processing of all numeric fields before API submission
   - Support for unit-suffixed values ("50kg", "25.5km")

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/controllers/deliveriesController.js` - Complete field mapping implementation
- `frontend/src/components/test/TestPage.tsx` - Enhanced data processing

**Commit**: `6cb788b` - "Implement complete 52-field storage and display system"

##### 2. Railway Deployment Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Multiple deployment errors including trust proxy warnings and decimal validation failures.

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **Trust Proxy Security Warning**:
   ```javascript
   // Added secure rate limiting for Railway proxy environment
   app.set('trust proxy', true);
   keyGenerator: (req) => {
     const forwardedFor = req.headers['x-forwarded-for'];
     return forwardedFor ? forwardedFor.split(',')[0].trim() : req.ip;
   }
   ```

2. **Decimal Validation Errors**:
   ```javascript
   // Robust numeric field parsing with validation
   const parseNumber = (value) => {
     if (typeof value === 'string') {
       return parseFloat(value.replace(/[^0-9.-]/g, ''));
     }
     return value;
   };
   ```

3. **Graceful Shutdown Handling**:
   ```javascript
   process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
     server.close(() => process.exit(0));
   });
   ```

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.js` - Trust proxy, rate limiting, graceful shutdown
