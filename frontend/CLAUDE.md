# CLAUDE.md - Frontend Development Log

This file documents the development work performed by Claude Code on the frontend React application.

## Project Overview

This is a React/TypeScript frontend application for a delivery management system. The app provides admin dashboard functionality for managing deliveries, products, users, and drivers.

## Recent Development Work

### HTML Coverage Component Restoration (2025-01-21)

Successfully restored multiple core components from HTML coverage files located in `/Users/lyuhyeogsang/hy/easypicks/frontend/coverage/frontend/src/components/`.

#### ProductManagement Component Restoration
- **Source**: Extracted from HTML coverage files
- **Location**: `/Users/lyuhyeogsang/hy2/frontend/src/components/products/ProductManagement.tsx`
- **Features**: Complete product CRUD operations with photo management
- **Dependencies**: Added `productsAPI` and `productPhotosAPI` to services

2. Extract original implementations rather than creating placeholders
3. Maintain consistent prop interfaces and TypeScript typing
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states

### API Development
1. Create corresponding backend endpoints before frontend integration
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. Use consistent response formats across all endpoints
4. Include comprehensive error handling and logging

### Testing and Deployment
1. Always run build tests before committing changes
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible and functional
3. Test component integration in development environment
4. Monitor deployment logs for any runtime errors

## Latest Session: User Management & Partner Edit Fix (2025-09-22)

### Issues Resolved

#### User Management Display Problem
**Problem**: Test page showed partner list correctly, but user management form showed no users.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Partner List (Working)**: Used `testAPI.getPartnersList()` → `/api/test/partners` - fully implemented
- **User Management (Broken)**: Used `userAPI.getAllUsers()` → `/api/users` - only dummy implementation

**Investigation Process**:
1. ✅ Analyzed PartnersListModal component API calls
2. ✅ Analyzed UserManagement component API calls  
3. ✅ Compared API endpoints and backend implementation
4. ✅ Found `/api/users` endpoint only returned `{ message: '사용자 목록 API' }`

**Solution Implemented**:
- Complete implementation of `/backend/routes/users.js` with:
  - Real database queries for user data
  - Pagination support (page, limit parameters)
  - Search functionality (username, name, email, company)
  - Role filtering capability
  - Admin authorization checks
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Structured response with users array and pagination data

**Commit**: `e41cb4d` - "Fix user management API - implement complete users endpoint"

#### Partner Edit Modal 404 Error
**Problem**: Partner edit modal failed with "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404" error.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Frontend called `userAPI.updateUser()` → `PUT /users/:id`
- Backend `/routes/users.js` only had GET endpoint, missing PUT/POST/DELETE operations

**Solution Implemented**:
Complete CRUD API implementation in `/backend/routes/users.js`:

1. **GET /users/:id** - Single user retrieval
   - User existence validation
   - Proper error handling for not found cases
   - Clean response format with boolean type conversion

2. **POST /users** - User creation
   - Required field validation (username, password, name)
   - Username uniqueness checks
   - Password handling (with note for bcrypt in production)
   - Support for all user fields including partner-specific data

3. **PUT /users/:id** - User updates (fixes partner edit modal)
   - Dynamic field updates (only provided fields)
   - User existence validation
   - Username uniqueness validation (excluding current user)
   - Comprehensive field support for partner information

4. **DELETE /users/:id** - User deletion
   - User existence validation
   - Soft delete option available
   - Detailed logging and response

**Technical Features**:
- Admin role requirement for all operations
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Database transaction safety with executeWithRetry
- Comprehensive error handling with structured responses
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Input validation and sanitization
- Support for partner-specific fields (default_sender_address, etc.)

**Commit**: `ee1c8b4` - "Add complete CRUD operations for users API"

### AWS Lightsail Migration Attempt

#### Migration Planning
- Analyzed current Railway deployment ($30/month)
- Planned migration to AWS Lightsail Medium ($20/month) for cost savings
- Created comprehensive migration documentation

#### Migration Execution
**Completed Steps**:
1. ✅ AWS CLI installation and credential setup
2. ✅ Lightsail container service creation (us-east-1 region)
3. ✅ Docker image build and optimization (267MB)
4. ✅ Docker Hub push (`miraepartner/easypicks-backend:latest`)
5. ✅ Environment variable configuration with PlanetScale DB settings
6. ✅ Deployment configuration with health checks

**Deployment Issues**:
- Container deployments repeatedly failed with "Took too long" errors
- Health check failures despite working locally
- Tried multiple configurations:
  - Adjusted health check timeouts (5s → 30s)
  - Increased failure thresholds (2 → 10)
  - Changed health check paths (`/health` → `/`)
  - Disabled health checks entirely
- Local testing showed container worked perfectly

**Migration Cancellation**:
- After multiple deployment failures, decided to abort migration
- Cleaned up AWS resources:
  - Deleted Lightsail container service
  - Removed local Docker images
  - Verified no ongoing charges
- Continued with Railway for stability

**Lessons Learned**:
- Lightsail container deployment can be challenging with Node.js apps
- Health check configuration is critical but sometimes unpredictable
- Local testing doesn't always translate to cloud deployment success
- Railway remains reliable despite higher cost
